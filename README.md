# HOMAG Connect

HOMAG Connect provides the ability to seamlessly integrate HOMAG applications into existing business processes and systems through programmatic access.

## ⚠️ Security Responsibilities When Using Basic Authentication

Our public API uses **Basic Authentication**.  
Authentication credentials consist of:

*   **Username:** Your `SubscriptionId` (GUID)
*   **Password:** A password generated by you in the management interface

You can create or revoke this password at any time.

### 🔐 Secure Handling of Credentials (Customer Responsibility)

You, as the customer, are **fully responsible** for securely storing and protecting your API credentials.  
These credentials grant full access to all API endpoints available to your subscription, including operations that may modify or delete data. Improper handling can lead to unauthorized access and potential data loss.

### 🚫 Prohibited Use

The API password **must never** be used or stored in any client‑side or publicly accessible environment, such as:

*   Browser-based JavaScript
*   Frontend web applications
*   Mobile apps or desktop apps that can be decompiled
*   Public repositories or shared configuration files

Any environment where the password can be viewed, extracted, or intercepted by end users is **strictly forbidden**.

### ✅ Allowed Use

The password may only be used in:

*   Secure backend systems
*   Server-side services
*   Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication
*   Applications that are not publicly distributed and cannot be accessed or inspected by end users

### 🔄 Password Management

If you suspect that your password has been exposed:

1.  Immediately delete it in the management interface
2.  Generate a new password
3.  Update your backend systems accordingly

### 🛡️ Responsibility Acknowledgment

By using this API, you confirm that:

*   You are solely responsible for the protection of your access credentials
*   You ensure that passwords are stored securely and used only in secure environments
*   Any misuse resulting from insecure storage or exposure of credentials falls under your responsibility
