# Authentication / Authorization

In order to access a HOMAG application via the respective HOMAG Connect REST API, you must have a licence for the relevant application and the necessary authentication details, which include the Subscription Id (username) and an Authorization Key (password).

The license can be purchased as an Add-on to the application in the tapio Marketplace.

The Subscription Id and Authorization Key can be obtained by subscription administrators following these steps:

- Log in to your Tapio account at https://my.tapio.one.
