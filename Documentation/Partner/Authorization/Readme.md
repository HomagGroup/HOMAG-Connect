# Authentication / Authorization for tapio Partners

HOMAG Connect APIs provide customers with the ability to seamlessly integrate HOMAG applications into their existing business processes and systems through programmatic access. To utilize the API, the HOMAG Connect Add-on must be licensed for each application, and authentication is achieved using the SubscriptionId and an Authorization Key.

```c#
// Create new instance of the productionManager client:

var subscriptionId = // Customer subscription id
var authorizationKey = // Authorization Key generated by the customer in SmartWOPConnect add-on
            
var client = new ProductionManagerClient(subscriptionId, authorizationKey);
```

For more information on authentication and authorization for customers, please refer to the details provided in the [HOMAG Connect](../../../Applications/IntelliDivide/Samples/Authentication) documentation.

The HOMAG Connect APIs provide [tapio partners](https://docs.homag.cloud/en/data-exchange/in-a-nutshell/partner) with the ability to seamlessly integrate and streamline processes for their customers by accessing HOMAG apps. Additionally, tapio partners can develop and offer their own add-ons to HOMAG applications on the platform. To authenticate and access the HOMAG Connect API, partners use a PartnerId provided by HOMAG and an Authorization Key, which can be created by the customer within the partner add-on.

```c#
// Create new instance of the productionManager client:

var partnerId = // Partner Id provided by HOMAG
var authorizationKey = // Authorization Key generated by the customer in HOMAG Connect add-on
            
var client = new ProductionManagerClient(partnerId, authorizationKey);
``` 

During authentication, the system verifies if the customer has licensed the relevant add-on for the specific application and PartnerId, and grants or denies access based on this information. This ensures that only authorized users can access the integrated processes.

## Ein Beispiel zur Umsetzung eines Partner Add-ons

SmartWOP allows customers to transfer orders directly to productionManager. This eliminates the intermediate step of manually exporting and importing orders. This makes the process much smoother and less error prone.

To use this feature, the customer must license the SmartWOPConnect productionManager add-on at [tapio Marketplace](https://customerportal.tapio.one/marketplace/ccp/v/pa/marketplace/home-view?vendorId=1022097719).

![tapio marketplace](Partner_Authorization-01.png "tapio marketplace")

This add-on is then available at [my.tapio.one](https://my.tapio.one) in the HOMAG productionManager application.

![my.tapio.one](Partner_Authorization-02.png "my.tapio.one")

In the Authorization Keys dialog, the customer can generate a new Authorization Key.

![Authorization Keys dialog](Partner_Authorization-04.png "Authorization Keys dialog")

![Authorization Keys dialog](Partner_Authorization-05.png "Authorization Keys dialog")

The generated Authorization Key is [inserted into smartWOP](https://docs.homag.cloud/en/smartwop/in-a-nutshell/enter-interface-license). 

![SmartWOP](Partner_Authorization-06.png "Export to productionManager")

It is then used to authenticate the partner add-on in the HOMAG Connect productionManager API when exporting a project.

![SmartWOP](Partner_Authorization-07.png "Export to productionManager")

```c#
// Create new instance of the productionManager client

var partnerId = // SmartWOP Partner Id
var authorizationKey = // Authorization Key generated by the customer in SmartWOPConnect add-on
            
var productionManagerClient = new ProductionManagerClient(partnerId, authorizationKey);

// Send project from smartWOP to productionManager

var projectFile = new FileInfo(@"Project.zip");
            
var request = new ImportOrderRequest
{
    Action = ImportOrderRequestAction.ImportOnly
};

var response = await productionManagerClient.ImportOrderAsync(request, projectFile);

```
