# Utilize Templates to Analyze Material Data with Excel

The data retrieved from the materialManager and materialAssist API can be used to create comprehensive reports within Excel.  

We have developed templates that can be used as a basis for creating your own customized reports.

Please check the [Analyze data with Excel](../../../../../../Documentation/Tools/Excel/Readme.md) page for more information about how to use them.

## Templates

- [Board disposal candidates](DisposalCandidates/Readme.md)<br>
The report lists board entities by age and material last used date, with those at the top being potential candidates for disposal due to low likelihood of use, taking up storage space.
