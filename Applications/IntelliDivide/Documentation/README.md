# HOMAG IntelliDivide Client

The [HOMAG IntelliDivide Client](./homagconnect.intellidivide.client.intellidivideclient.md) enables access to the intelliDivide application for integration into your own applications. The functions offered on the website are available for a programmatic integration.

The HOMAG IntelliDivide Client is written in C# ([Source Code](./../Client/IntelliDivideClient.cs)). It facilitates access to the intelliDivide REST API. The source code can be used to convert the relevant functions for integration into another programming language.
